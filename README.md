### Summary
JesterBot was developed on Google Dialogflow and serves as an exercise for serving media to group chats on Telegram.   

This chat bot was created to be an icebreaker and mood lightener in the oftentimes melancholic environment brought upon by the Covid-19 Pandemic.   

Every time JesterBot detects recurring negativity in a group chat it sends a video (1 of 30) of a world-renowned comedian's stand up routine to ease tensions and spread good vibes.
